#Proposal

##Part 1 : 
###Why are we here?
We are here to fulfill the client’s needs for creating a new Humber ESports Varsity Team website. The main need and purpose is to spread what ESports are, how students can get involved in them in order to increase the community connection, and what are the chances to get job opportunities and get more members into the community.


###Why have you written this?
We have written this document because we will demonstrate why DRUPAL CM is the best option to elaborate and develop this project due to its complexity, functionality, features and structure. Drupal has been chosen as the Content Management System (CMS) for this project after a thorough assessment of the goals and needs of the customer. Drupal is an open-source CMS platform that small-to-large organizations can use freely without fear of vendor lock-in, low cost of implementation due to enormous amounts of freely available community code, and robust and flexible architecture ready for the enterprise. So, it provides the security, scalability, and flexibility required to meet HCE's changing requirements and expansion in the future. 

###Overall Goals
Main goal: Create a functional CMS which allows the client to control the website easily, edit and manage the content as they need, and update or add new information. The CMS should be able to:
Display the Humber ESports content.
Show Humber ESports history and the current staff in charge.
Promote merchandise and events.
Have a guided tour online about the campus, the e-sports they do and the tools/locations they use for the players.
Show the players who are currently participating in diverse activities or competitions.
Show the guest on the page.
Display streaming of tournaments if they are available. 
Let guests become part of members of the website.
Create databases needed to make the website work such has sponsorships, links to twitch, guided tours, admin/guest logins.
Offered career opportunities.
Resources and guides required for guests.


###What are the success criteria? You would test your assumptions about the project here and know how to get the client’s attention
The client can easily learn all the functionality of the CMS. Functional and manageable website in  which the  client feels comfortable to work with.
The CMS is easily scalable to fit an extended feature list if the client wishes to pursue extra features
All MVP criteria are met as well as some nice-to have features.






##Part 2:

###What is Esports?
Esports is the digitalization of sports, which are competitive, but organized video gaming.

###Why is it important?
It is important because it is changing the mindset about gaming and sports digitally. Not only does it make the gaming community grow, but it also lets players earn money from a hobby they enjoy playing. It also moves money in these kind of tournaments among players, which is attractive to investors and organizations who are looking for new opportunities and incomes. Esports involves the improvement of health, the awareness and benefits of well-being as individuals.

###What can this do for the people in the main and subordinate target audiences? If you have a user scenario in mind – this might be the place to bring it up and use it in selling this project.
Our main target audience is millennials. 

###There are other Esports organizations – how have they solved the problem we are trying to solve?
The current problems Esports is facing are limited reach, leak of online presence, information management, promotion of events, sponsorship opportunities.
 
###Will you copy those solutions or offer something different? Or both?
